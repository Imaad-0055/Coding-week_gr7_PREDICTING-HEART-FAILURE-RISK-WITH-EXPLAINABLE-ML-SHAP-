# PROJECT 1 : predicting heart failure risk with explainable ML SHAP
  This project aims to enhance clinical decision-making by providing an **explainable machine learning model** for predicting heart failure risk. By leveraging **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**, our approach ensures **transparency and interpretability**, allowing physicians to understand the reasoning behind each prediction. The system is designed to be **efficient, user-friendly, and professionally deployed**, featuring a **Streamlit or Flask interface** for seamless interaction. Additionally, best software development practices, including **CI/CD automation**, are incorporated to ensure a robust and scalable solution.
## Objectives  ðŸš€:
- Develop a robust and accurate machine learning model to predict heart failure risk.
- Ensure model interpretability using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for transparent decision-making.
- Design an intuitive user interface with Streamlit or Flask for seamless interaction.
- Optimize memory usage to improve efficiency and scalability.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- Apply prompt engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven workflows and documentation.
